tldr: The user reported that the previews for Starfield, Pipes, and 3D Maze
  screensavers didn't match the actual "ride." The fix involved refactoring the
  preview system to embed the real screensaver components directly into the
  preview thumbnails, ensuring visual consistency.
overview: The user initiated a request to fix the visual discrepancy between the
  screensaver previews (Starfield, Pipes, 3D Maze) and their actual full-screen
  counterparts. The existing previews were simple, hand-drawn canvas animations
  that didn't accurately represent the screensavers. The approach taken was to
  refactor the  component to embed the actual ,
  , and  screensaver components directly into the preview
  thumbnails. This involved adding new props (, , ,
  ) to the screensaver components to allow them to render within a
  specified container size rather than relying on window dimensions. A
   was used to dynamically measure the preview container's
  dimensions and pass them to the embedded screensavers. Additionally,
  parameters within each screensaver (e.g., number of stars, pipe width, ray
  count) were adjusted to scale down gracefully for the smaller preview size,
  ensuring both visual fidelity and performance. The outcome is that the
  screensaver previews now closely resemble the actual screensaver experience.
