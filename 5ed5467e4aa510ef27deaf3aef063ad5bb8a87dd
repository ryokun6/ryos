tldr: The user reported that the previews for Starfield, Pipes, and 3D Maze
  screensavers did not accurately represent the actual screensavers. The fix
  involved updating the previews to render the actual screensaver components
  directly within the preview box, with adjusted settings for the smaller size.
overview: "The user initiated a request to fix the visual discrepancy between
  the previews of the Starfield, Pipes, and 3D Maze screensavers and their
  actual 'ride' counterparts. The existing previews were simple, hand-drawn
  canvas animations that didn't accurately reflect the real screensavers. The
  solution involved a significant change in approach: instead of placeholder
  animations, the actual screensaver components (, , )
  were embedded directly into the 's preview area. These
  components were modified to accept optional , , and
  props, allowing them to render within a small container. A
  was implemented to dynamically measure the preview container's dimensions and
  pass them to the embedded screensavers. Furthermore, the screensaver logic was
  adjusted to scale down parameters like the number of stars, pipe grid size,
  and maze ray count when in preview mode, ensuring a lightweight yet visually
  consistent experience. This change ensures the previews now look much closer
  to the actual screensavers."
