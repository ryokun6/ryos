tldr: The user wants to run  and fix any compilation errors. The
  assistant is preparing to execute the build, capture errors, and then
  iteratively fix them.
overview: The user initiated a request to run a  command and
  resolve any errors that might occur. The assistant's approach involves an
  initial check of the  directory to clear any existing processes,
  followed by executing the build command. The plan is to capture the build
  output, identify errors, and then proceed with fixing them in the code,
  re-running the build as necessary until it completes successfully.
