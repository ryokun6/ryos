tldr: The user asked for effective ways to integrate YouTube search without
  hitting API restrictions. The assistant provided a comprehensive guide,
  recommending the official YouTube Data API with robust caching and rate
  limiting, and also suggested alternative methods like using third-party
  front-ends or a "paste URL" approach.
overview: The user wanted to implement YouTube search functionality while
  avoiding API restrictions. The assistant provided a detailed breakdown of
  several strategies. The primary recommendation was to use the official YouTube
  Data API through a server-side proxy, implementing aggressive caching with
  tools like Vercel KV or CDN, and applying rate limiting per user/IP. This
  approach aims to minimize quota usage and ensure long-term stability.
  Alternative methods included leveraging third-party YouTube front-ends like
  Invidious or Piped, or a user experience where users search on YouTube
  directly and paste the URL into the app, completely bypassing API usage.
  Scraping was strongly advised against due to instability and terms of service
  violations. The assistant also offered to tailor the advice further based on
  specific application needs.
