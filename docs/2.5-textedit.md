## User Guide

### Getting Started
To launch TextEdit, simply click its icon in the ryOS application launcher. A new, blank document will open automatically, ready for you to begin typing. You can start creating your content immediately or use the "File" menu to open an existing document.

### Key Actions
*   **Basic Text Entry & Manipulation:** Type directly into the editor pane. Use standard keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl/Cmd+C` for copy, `Ctrl/Cmd+X` for cut, `Ctrl/Cmd+V` for paste, `Ctrl/Cmd+Z` for undo, `Ctrl/Cmd+Y` for redo) for common text operations.
*   **Applying Formatting:** Utilize the intuitive toolbar located at the top of the editor to apply text styles like bold, italic, or underline, select heading levels, or adjust text alignment.
*   **Creating Lists:** Click the respective icons in the toolbar to effortlessly create bulleted lists, numbered lists, or interactive checkbox task lists.
*   **Saving and Opening Files:** Access the "File" menu in the menubar to save your current document, save it under a new name, or open an existing file from your ryOS file system.
*   **Exporting Documents:** From the "File" menu, choose the "Export" option to save your document in different formats such as HTML, Markdown, or plain text, catering to various sharing and usage needs.
*   **Voice Dictation:** Click the microphone icon (typically found in the toolbar or menubar) to initiate voice dictation. Speak clearly, and your words will be transcribed directly into your document. Click the icon again to stop dictation.
*   **Using Slash Commands:** Type a forward slash (`/`) anywhere within your document to reveal a context-sensitive list of quick commands. Select a command (e.g., `/h1` for a Heading 1, `/bullet list` for a bullet point) to instantly apply formatting or insert specific elements.

### Tips & Shortcuts
*   **Drag and Drop:** TextEdit supports dragging text snippets within the editor for easy reordering. You can often also drag supported file types from the ryOS Files app directly into TextEdit to open them.
*   **Markdown Shorthand:** Leverage TextEdit's markdown capabilities by typing common markdown syntax. For example, `# My Heading` followed by Enter will create a Heading 1, and `* item` will create a bullet point.
*   **Contextual Menus:** Right-clicking on selected text or within the editor can reveal additional formatting and editing options specific to the context.

### State Management
TextEdit primarily manages its complex rich text editor state locally within the `TextEditor` component, leveraging a robust editor framework. The `EditorProvider.tsx` component likely provides the editor instance and its associated state to various child components throughout the application, ensuring consistent access and interaction. Additionally, the `useTextEditState` hook suggests the management of application-wide settings, document-specific properties like file status, and UI configurations, typically handled through React's local state mechanisms and potentially context for broader app scope.
