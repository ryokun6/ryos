# Stickies

Stickies is a simple yet effective note-taking application for ryOS, designed to help users quickly jot down reminders and organize their thoughts directly on their digital desktop. It provides a flexible and visually distinct way to keep important information at your fingertips, enhancing productivity and information recall.

## Overview

Stickies serves as a digital equivalent of physical sticky notes, allowing ryOS users to place colorful, resizable notes anywhere on their desktop.

The application focuses on ease of use and visual organization. Notes remain visible and accessible, ensuring that important information is always at a glance. Whether for remembering a deadline, noting down a phone number, or outlining a quick idea, Stickies integrates seamlessly into the ryOS environment to enhance personal productivity and information recall.
