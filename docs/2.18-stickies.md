# Stickies

Stickies is a simple yet powerful note-taking application for ryOS, allowing users to quickly jot down reminders and organize thoughts using colorful, persistent sticky notes right on their desktop. It provides an intuitive way to keep important information readily accessible within your digital workspace.

## Overview

The Stickies app provides a convenient and familiar way to keep important information at your fingertips within the ryOS environment. It mimics the experience of physical sticky notes, but with the added benefits of digital persistence and easy organization. Users can create multiple notes, customize their colors for visual categorization, and rely on automatic saving to ensure their reminders are always there when they return. This app is ideal for quick memos, task lists, temporary data storage, or anything that needs to be readily accessible without the need for a full document editor.

## Technical Details

### Window Configuration

### Component Architecture
The app consists of 3 component file(s):

*   `src/apps/stickies/components/StickiesMenuBar.tsx`: Manages the application's top menu bar, handling actions like creating new notes, clearing all notes, and showing dialogs.
*   `src/apps/stickies/components/StickyNote.tsx`: Represents an individual sticky note, handling its content, color, position, and close button.
*   `src/apps/stickies/components/StickiesAppComponent.tsx`: The main application component that orchestrates the display of the menu bar and all individual sticky notes, coordinating their interactions.

### Hooks & Utilities
**Custom Hooks:**
*   `src/apps/stickies/hooks/useStickiesLogic.ts`: This hook encapsulates the core business logic for the Stickies app, managing the collection of notes, their creation, deletion, color changes, and selection, as well as dialog states and persistence.

### State Management
The Stickies app primarily manages its state using local React state, orchestrated by the `useStickiesLogic` custom hook. This includes the array of individual `notes`, the currently `selectedNoteId`, and the visibility of various dialogs (Help, About). Note data is persisted automatically between ryOS sessions, leveraging local browser storage mechanisms managed within the `useStickiesLogic` hook.

*   **Text Editor:** For more extensive note-taking or document creation that requires richer formatting, spell-checking, and file management capabilities.
*   **Calendar:** To integrate reminders and tasks from Stickies into a scheduled timeline, providing a broader view of your commitments.
