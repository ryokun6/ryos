# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is the classic puzzle game reimagined for ryOS, where players uncover a grid to locate hidden mines without triggering them. It provides an engaging and strategic experience, perfect for quick mental challenges.

## Overview

Minesweeper brings the timeless grid-based puzzle game directly to your ryOS desktop. The objective is simple: reveal all the safe cells on the board while avoiding the hidden mines. Players use logic and deduction, guided by numbers that indicate how many mines are adjacent to a revealed cell, to strategically clear the board.

This app is designed for both casual play and dedicated puzzle enthusiasts, offering a familiar yet fresh experience within the ryOS environment. Its intuitive controls are optimized for both traditional desktop interactions with a mouse and keyboard, as well as touch-based navigation on mobile devices, ensuring accessibility and enjoyment across various platforms.

## Features

*   **Intuitive Control Scheme:**
    *   **Desktop:** Left-click to reveal a cell, right-click to flag a suspected mine, and double-click on a numbered cell (once the correct number of flags are placed around it) to auto-reveal its unflagged neighbors.
    *   **Mobile:** Tap a cell to reveal it, and long-press to flag or unflag a potential mine.
*   **Classic Gameplay Rules:** Adheres to the traditional Minesweeper rules where numbers on revealed cells indicate the count of adjacent mines. The game is won by successfully flagging all mines and revealing every safe cell.
*   **Real-time Mine Counter:** A convenient display in the top bar shows the current count of unflagged mines alongside the total number of mines on the board, helping players track their progress.
*   **Quick Restart Option:** Easily initiate a new game at any point by clicking the prominent smiley face icon on the board or by selecting `Game ▸ New` from the application's menu bar.

## User Guide

### Getting Started
To begin playing Minesweeper, simply launch the app from the ryOS app launcher. A new game board will automatically be generated, ready for you to start uncovering cells and strategizing your next move.

### Key Actions
*   **Reveal Cells:** Click (desktop) or tap (mobile) on any unrevealed cell to uncover its content. If it's a number, it indicates how many mines are in the surrounding 8 cells. If it's a blank space, it means no mines are adjacent, and often clears a larger area.
*   **Flag Mines:** If you suspect a cell contains a mine, right-click (desktop) or long-press (mobile) on it to place a flag. This helps you mark potential dangers and prevents accidental clicks. Right-clicking or long-pressing again will remove the flag.
*   **Auto-Reveal Neighbors:** On desktop, once a numbered cell has the exact number of flags placed around it as indicated by its number, you can double-click that numbered cell. This action will automatically reveal all its unflagged, unrevealed neighboring cells, speeding up gameplay.
*   **Restart Game:** To begin a fresh game with a new board, click the smiley face icon located at the top of the game window, or navigate to `Game > New` in the application's menu bar.

### Tips & Shortcuts
*   The smiley face button is a quick and easy way to restart your current game without navigating through menus.
*   Leverage the double-click feature on desktop to efficiently clear large sections of the board once you're confident about the surrounding mine placements.
*   Keep an eye on the mine counter to manage your strategy and understand how many mines are left to find.
